    <h4>My Teaching Experience</h4>
    <p>I never imagined to be a teacher but in this particular situation it was a way to support 
        myself while living abroad. I chose South Korea because it had great perks working for the 
        public school systems. (Free apartment and free flights anyone?!)
    <br>
    I was placed in a rural location and the though of that was quite scary but in the end it was not
    bad whatsoever. I taught 5th and 6th grade in elementary and 7th and 8th in middle school. My 
    apartment was about 1 mile from school and it took about 15 minutes walking. My favorite time to walk
    to school was in the winter. It so satisfying feeling the 20 degree weather hit my face. Growing up in 
    Florida, I am so over the heat.

    <h4>My Favorite Places in Korea</h4>
    <h4>Countries I Visited</h4>
    <p>One of the my goals of living abroad was to visit different countries because 
        <li>
        It's so cheap to travel since I'm so nearby already </ol>
        Why not? 
        </li>
       I traveled to Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Japan (twice!), Hong Kong, and China.
