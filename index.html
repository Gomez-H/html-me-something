    <h1 class="center" id="main-title">My Year Abroad in Korea</h1>
    <p>In August 2016, I hopped on a one-way flight to Korea. My goal for this adventure was just that to have an adventure. I don't regret it at all

    <h4 class="center">My Teaching Experience</h4>
    <p>I never imagined to be a teacher but in this particular situation it was a way to support 
        myself while living abroad. I chose South Korea because it had great perks working for the 
        public school systems. (Free apartment and free flights anyone?!)
    <br>
    I was placed in a rural location and the thought of that was quite scary but in the end it was not
    bad whatsoever. I taught English to 5th and 6th grades in elementary and 7th and 8th in middle school. My 
    apartment was about 1 mile from school and it took about 15 minutes walking. My favorite time to walk
    to school was in the winter. It so satisfying feeling the 20 degree weather hit my face.  <br>

    <h4 class="center">My favorite Memories in Korea</h4>
    <p>North Korea: I knew this was something I could not leave Korea without doing. It was a surreal
        experience knowing North Korea was a few steps away.

    <p>First Snow: Growing up in Florida, I've never seen a proper snowfall. It did not snow alot in my town
        but when it did I was all giddy.  <br>

    <h4 class="center">Countries I Visited</h4>
    <p>One of the my main goals of living abroad was to visit different countries 
        because since I'm was Asia already, it's cheaper to travel within Asia.
        I traveled to Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Japan (twice!), Hong Kong, and China.
