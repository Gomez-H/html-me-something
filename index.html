    <h1 class="center" id="main-title">My Year Abroad in Korea</h1>
    <p>In August 2016, I hopped on a one-way flight to Korea. My goal for this adventure was just that to have an adventure. I don't regret it at all

    <h4 class="center">My Teaching Experience</h4>
    <p>I never imagined to be a teacher but in this particular situation it was a way to support 
        myself while living abroad. I chose South Korea because it had great perks working for the 
        public school systems. (Free apartment and free flights anyone?!)
    <br>
    I was placed in a rural location and the though of that was quite scary but in the end it was not
    bad whatsoever. I taught 5th and 6th grade in elementary and 7th and 8th in middle school. My 
    apartment was about 1 mile from school and it took about 15 minutes walking. My favorite time to walk
    to school was in the winter. It so satisfying feeling the 20 degree weather hit my face. Growing up in 
    Florida, I am so over the heat.

    <h4 class="center">My Favorite Memories in Korea</h4>
    <p>North Korea: I knew this was something I could not leave Korea without doing. It was a surreal
        experience. 
    </p>

    <p>First Snow: Growing up in Florida, I've never seen a proper snowfall. It did not snow alot in my town
        but when it did Iwas all giddy. One morning, I was recording my walk to school and I managed to 
        record the first time I slipped. I was wearing sneakers. My fellow co-teachers said it was unusual 
        for it to snow so little. They usually get more. It seems I brought the heat with me from Florida.

    <h4 class="center">Countries I Visited</h4>
    <p>One of the my goals of living abroad was to visit different countries because 
        It's so cheap to travel since I'm so nearby already </ol>
        Why not? 
       I traveled to Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Japan (twice!), Hong Kong, and China.
